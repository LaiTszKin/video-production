  short_description: "Generate 16:9 long-form videos with plan confirmation, fresh images, and timeline animations"
  default_prompt: "Use $video-production to produce long-form videos (more than 10 minutes) by following user instructions. For text inputs, extract a coherent long-form story arc, split it into timed chapters, and keep final output at 16:9 (default 1920x1080). Before generating or updating prompts, detect recurring roles and ensure <project_dir>/roles/roles.json exists first (create it if missing using references/roles-json.md), then reuse existing role prompt skeletons and generate new role entries only for undefined roles using the supported JSON prompt schema. Do not reuse previously generated storyboard pictures; generate fresh storyboard images for each run unless the user supplies external assets. If required details are missing, ask interactive clarifying questions first (for example target duration, chapter pacing, subtitle style, voice, animation style, or role prompt source). Before any generation starts, create a plan markdown at <project_dir>/docs/long-video-plans/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<content_name>.md from references/plan-template.md with only these sections: meta data, reference text, images needed to be generated, and animation plan for audience retention. In the reference text section, refer to source locations only and do not embed full long text. Replace all square-bracket placeholders with concrete content, remove placeholder/instruction text, and then wait for explicit user confirmation. Do not ask whether output should be single or multi-episode; infer from the user request (default to single unless episodes are explicitly requested). Use docs-to-voice when audio/subtitles are missing and remotion-best-practices for final assembly. The final render must include timeline animations to maintain audience focus. Keep the Remotion workspace and ensure its .gitignore excludes dependency/build/cache artifacts (such as node_modules/) so git repositories stay clean."
