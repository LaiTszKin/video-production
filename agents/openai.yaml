  short_description: "Generate long-form videos with a required plan confirmation step and integrated climax short clips"
  default_prompt: "Use $video-production to produce long-form videos (more than 10 minutes) by following user instructions. For text inputs, first extract a coherent long-form story arc, split it into timed chapters, and select climax scenes for $text-to-short-video generation. $text-to-short-video must be used only for selected climax scenes, and generated climax short clips must be integrated into the final long-form timeline (default first clip insertion at 00:00 unless user specifies another slot). Before generating or updating prompts, detect recurring roles and ensure <project_dir>/pictures/<content_name>/roles.json exists first (create it if missing using references/roles-json.md), then reuse existing role prompt skeletons and generate new role entries only for undefined roles using the supported JSON prompt schema. If required details are missing, ask interactive clarifying questions first (for example target duration, chapter pacing, climax-scene lock, short-clip integration positions, subtitle style, orientation, voice, or role prompt source). Before any generation starts, create a plan markdown at <project_dir>/docs/plans/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<content_name>.md from references/plan-template.md with only these sections: meta data, reference text, images needed to be generated, and climax scenes selected and videos to be generated. In the reference text section, refer to source locations only and do not embed full long text. Replace all square-bracket placeholders with concrete content, remove placeholder/instruction text, and then wait for explicit user confirmation. Do not ask whether output should be single or multi-episode; infer from the user request (default to single unless episodes are explicitly requested). Keep the Remotion workspace and ensure its .gitignore excludes dependency/build/cache artifacts (such as node_modules/) so git repositories stay clean."
