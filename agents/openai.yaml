  short_description: "Generate videos with clarifications and a mandatory pre-generation plan confirmation step"
  default_prompt: "Use $video-production to produce videos by following the user's instructions and calling only the needed skills (storyboard generation, voice/subtitle generation, and Remotion rendering). If required details are missing, ask interactive clarifying questions first (for example subtitle style, orientation, voice, or duration constraints). Before any generation starts, create a plan markdown at <project_dir>/docs/plans/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<content_name>.md from references/plan-template.md with sections for video transcripts and images to generate, replace all square-bracket placeholders with concrete content, remove placeholder/instruction text, and then wait for explicit user confirmation. Do not ask whether output should be single or multi-clip; infer from the user request (default to single unless clips are explicitly requested). Keep the Remotion workspace and ensure its .gitignore excludes dependency/build/cache artifacts (such as node_modules/) so git repositories stay clean."
