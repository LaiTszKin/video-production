  short_description: "Generate long-form videos with clarifications and a mandatory pre-generation plan confirmation step"
  default_prompt: "Use $video-production to produce long-form videos (more than 10 minutes) by following the user's instructions. For text inputs, first extract a coherent long-form story arc and split it into timed chapters, then run the production flow with only required dependency skills. Before generating or updating prompts, detect recurring roles and ensure <project_dir>/pictures/<content_name>/roles.json exists first (create it if missing using references/roles-json.md), then reuse existing role prompt skeletons and generate new role entries only for undefined roles using the supported JSON prompt schema. If required details are missing, ask interactive clarifying questions first (for example target duration, chapter pacing, subtitle style, orientation, voice, or role prompt source). Before any generation starts, create a plan markdown at <project_dir>/docs/plans/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<content_name>.md from references/plan-template.md with sections for long-form structure, timing plan, video transcripts, prompt strategy, and images to generate, replace all square-bracket placeholders with concrete content, remove placeholder/instruction text, and then wait for explicit user confirmation. Do not ask whether output should be single or multi-episode; infer from the user request (default to single unless episodes are explicitly requested). Keep the Remotion workspace and ensure its .gitignore excludes dependency/build/cache artifacts (such as node_modules/) so git repositories stay clean. Use $text-to-short-video only when the user explicitly asks for teaser/highlight clips."
