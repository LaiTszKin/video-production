  short_description: "Generate videos with clarifications and a mandatory pre-generation plan confirmation step"
  default_prompt: "Use $video-production to produce videos by following the user's instructions. For text inputs, first abstract the most important segment and run the text-first flow through $text-to-short-video. Before generating or updating prompts, detect recurring roles and ensure <project_dir>/pictures/<content_name>/roles.json exists first (create it if missing using references/roles-json.md), then reuse existing role prompt skeletons and generate new role entries only for undefined roles using the supported JSON prompt schema. If required details are missing, ask interactive clarifying questions first (for example subtitle style, orientation, voice, duration constraints, or role prompt source). Before any generation starts, create a plan markdown at <project_dir>/docs/plans/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<content_name>.md from references/plan-template.md with sections for key segment, video transcripts, prompt strategy, and images to generate, replace all square-bracket placeholders with concrete content, remove placeholder/instruction text, and then wait for explicit user confirmation. Do not ask whether output should be single or multi-clip; infer from the user request (default to single unless clips are explicitly requested). Keep the Remotion workspace and ensure its .gitignore excludes dependency/build/cache artifacts (such as node_modules/) so git repositories stay clean."
